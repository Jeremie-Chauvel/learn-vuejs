# Why should I use vuejs ?

Starting this tutorial you already now how to create a basic page in HTML and style it using CSS, so should you learn a javascript framework ?

In term of user experience using a frontend framework will allow you to engage your user with dynamic display a lot more easily than just using native javascript or JQuery as you can see with the basic dior.com landing page:
